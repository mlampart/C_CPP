My service center will have many similarities to project4. The actual service center will be the MLH repository, that is, vehicles will be inserted(checked in), deleted(checked out), and...obtained(vehicle modification). The parent class is called Vehicle, and it'll have the properties outlined in the assignment as private variables. Each class thereafter will inherit from this class, and simply have accessor functions. The vehicle class will also have a function that assigns a task to it. Within the definition, there is a task struct that contains a name, cost, and pointer. These will be associated with each vehicle and the tasks will be stored via a linked list. When it comes time to add up the cost, and display the bill, I'll simply iterate through the list, accessing the data.
